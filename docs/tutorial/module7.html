<h3>Introduction</h3>
 
<p>Hadoop can be deployed on a variety of scales. The
requirements at each of these will be different. Hadoop has a large
number of tunable parameters that can be used to influence its
operation. Furthermore, there are a number of other technologies which
can be deployed with Hadoop for additional capabilities. This module
describes how to configure clusters to meet varying needs in terms of
size, processing power, and reliability and availability.</p>

<h3>Basic Setup</h3>
 
<p>This section discusses the general platform
requirements for Hadoop.</p>
  
<a name="java"></a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Java Requirements</h4>
 
<p>Hadoop is a Java-based system. Recent versions of
Hadoop require Sun Java 1.6. </p>
 
<p>Compiling Java programs to run on Hadoop can be done
with any number of commonly-used Java compilers. Sun's compiler is
fine, as is ecj, the Eclipse Compiler for Java. A bug in gcj, the GNU
Compiler for Java, causes incompatibility between generated classes and
Hadoop; it should not be used.</p>

<a name="os"></a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Operating System</h4>
 

<p>As Hadoop is written in Java, it is mostly portable
between different operating systems. Developers can and do run Hadoop
under Windows. The various scripts used to manage Hadoop clusters are
written in a UNIX shell scripting language that assumes <tt>sh</tt>-
or <tt>bash</tt>-like behavior. Thus running Hadoop under Windows
requires cygwin to be installed. The Hadoop documentation stresses that
a Windows/cygwin installation is for development only. The vast
majority of server deployments today are on Linux. (Other POSIX-style
operating systems such as BSD may also work. Some Hadoop users have
reported successfully running the system on Solaris.) The instructions
on this page assume a command syntax and system design similar to
Linux, but can be readily adapted to other systems. </p>

<a name="download"></a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Downloading and Installing Hadoop</h4>
 
<p>Hadoop is available for download from the project
homepage at <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/releases.html">http://hadoop.apache.org/core/releases.html</a>.
Here you will find several versions of Hadoop available.</p>

<p>The versioning strategy used is <i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>revision</i>.
Increments to the major version number represent large differences in
operation or interface and possibly significant incompatible changes.
At the time of this writing (September 2008), there have been no major
upgrades; all Hadoop versions have their major version set to 0. The
minor version represents a large set of feature improvements and
enhancements. Hadoop instances with different minor versions may use
different versions of the HDFS file formats and protocols, requiring a
DFS upgrade to migrate from one to the next. Revisions are used to
provide bug fixes. Within a minor version, the most recent revision
contains the most stable patches. </p>
<p>Within the releases page, two or three versions of Hadoop will be
readily available, corresponding to the highest revision number in the
most recent two or three minor version increments. The <i>stable</i>
version is the highest revision number in the second most recent minor
version. Production clusters should use this version. The most recent
minor version may include improved performance or new features, but may
also introduce regressions that will be fixed in ensuing revisions.</p>
<p>At the time of this writing, 0.18.0 is the most recent version, with
0.17.2 being the "stable" release. These example instructions assume
that version 0.18.0 is being used; the directions will not change
significantly for any other version, except by substituting the new
version number where appropriate.</p>
<p><b>To install Hadoop</b>, first download and install prerequisite
software. This includes Java 6 or higher. Distributed operation
requires ssh and sshd. Windows users must install and configure cygwin
as well. Then download a Hadoop version using a web browser, wget, or
curl, and then unzip the package:</p>

<div class="code">
	
<pre class="codeblue">gunzip hadoop-0.18.0.tar.gz
tar vxf hadoop-0.18.0.tar
</pre>

</div>
<p>Within the <tt>hadoop-0.18.0/</tt> directory which results, there
will be several subdirectories. The most interesting of these are <tt>bin/</tt>,
where scripts to run the cluster are located, and <tt>conf/</tt> where
the cluster's configuration is stored. </p>
<p>Enter the <tt>conf/</tt> directory and modify <tt>hadoop-env.sh</tt>.
The <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> variable must be set to the base directory of
your Java installation. It is recommended that you install Java in the
same location on all machines in the cluster, so this file can be
replicated to each machine without modification.</p>

<p>The <tt>hadoop-site.xml</tt> file must also be modified to contain
a number of configuration settings. The sections below address the
settings which should be included here.</p>
<p>If you are interested in setting up a development installation,
running Hadoop on a single machine, the Hadoop documentation includes <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/quickstart.html">quickstart</a>
instructions which will configure Hadoop for standalone or
"pseudo-distributed" operation. </p>
<p><b>Standalone</b> installations run all of Hadoop and your
application inside a single Java process. The distributed file system
is not used; file are read from and written to the local file system.
Such a setup can be helpful for debugging Hadoop applications.</p>
<p><b>Pseudo-distributed</b> operation refers to the use of several
separate processes representing the different daemons (NameNode,
DataNode, JobTracker, TaskTracker) and a separate task process to
perform a Hadoop job, but with all processes running on a single
machine. A pseudo-distributed instance will have a functioning
NameNode/DataNode managing a "DFS" of sorts. Files in HDFS are in a
separate namespace from the local file system, and are stored as block
objects in a Hadoop-managed directory. However, it is not truly
distributed, as no processing or data storage is performed on remote
notes. A pseudo-distributed instance can be extended into a fully
distributed cluster by adding more machines to function as
Task/DataNodes, but more configuration settings are usually required to
deploy a Hadoop cluster for multiple users. </p>

<p>The rest of this document deals with configuring Hadoop clusters of
multiple nodes, intended for use by one or more developers.</p>
<p>After the <tt>conf/hadoop-site.xml</tt> is configured according to
one of the models in the <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/quickstart.html">quickstart</a>,
the sections below, or your own settings, two more files must be
written. </p>
<p>The <b>conf/masters</b> file contains the hostname of the
SecondaryNameNode. This should be changed from "localhost" to the
fully-qualified domain name of the node to run the SecondaryNameNode
service. It does not need to contain the hostname of the
JobTracker/NameNode machine; that service is instantiated on whichever
node is used to run <tt>bin/start-all.sh</tt>, regardless of the <tt>masters</tt>

file. The <b>conf/slaves</b> file should contain the hostname of every
machine in the cluster which should start TaskTracker and DataNode
daemons. One hostname should be written per line in each of these
files, e.g.:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">slave01<br>slave02<br>slave03<br>...</pre>
</div>
<p>The master node does not usually also function as a slave node,
except in installations across only 1 or 2 machines.</p>
<p>If the nodes on your cluster do not support passwordless ssh, you
should configure this now:</p>

<pre class="codeblue">$ ssh-keygen -t dsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre>

<p>This will enable passwordless ssh login to the local machine. (You
can verify that this works by executing <tt>ssh localhost</tt>.) The <tt>~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub</tt>
and <tt>authorized_keys</tt> files should be replicated on all
machines in the cluster.</p>
<p>At this point, the configuration must be replicated across all nodes
in the cluster. Small clusters may use rsync or copy the configuration
directory to each node. Larger clusters should use a configuration
management system such as bcfg2, smartfrog, or puppet. NFS should be
avoided as much as is possible, as it is a scalability bottleneck.
DataNodes should never share block storage or other high-bandwidth
responsibilities over NFS, and should avoid sharing configuration
information over NFS if possible.</p>

<p>Various directories should be created on each node. The NameNode
requires the NameNode metadata directory:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ mkdir -p /home/hadoop/dfs/name</pre>
</div>
<p>And every node needs the Hadoop tmp directory and DataNode directory
created. Rather than logging in to each node and performing the steps
multiple times manually, the file <tt>bin/slaves.sh</tt> allows a
command to be executed on all nodes in the slaves file. For example, we
can create these directories by executing the following commands on the
NameNode:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ mkdir -p /tmp/hadoop  # make the NameNode's tmp dir<br>$ export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=${HADOOP_HOME}/conf<br>$ export HADOOP_SLAVES=${HADOOP_CONF_DIR}/slaves<br>$ ${HADOOP_HOME}/bin/slaves.sh "mkdir -p /tmp/hadoop"<br>$ ${HADOOP_HOME}/bin/slaves.sh "mkdir -p /home/hadoop/dfs/data"</pre>

</div>
<p>The environment variables <tt>$HADOOP_CONF_DIR</tt> and <tt>$HADOOP_SLAVES</tt>
are used by the <tt>bin/slaves.sh</tt> script to find the slave
machines list. The provided command is then executed over ssh. If you
need particular ssh options, the contents of the <tt>$HADOOP_SSH_OPTS</tt>
variable are passed to ssh as arguments.</p>
<p>We then format HDFS by executing the following command on the
NameNode:</p>

<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ bin/hadoop namenode -format</pre>
</div>
<p>And finally, start the cluster:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ bin/start-all.sh</pre>
</div>
<p>Now it is time to load in data and start processing it with Hadoop!
Good luck!</p>
<p>The remainder of this document discusses various trade-offs in
cluster configurations for different sizes, and reviews the settings
which may be placed in the <tt>hadoop-site.xml</tt> file.</p>

<a name="dirs"></a>
<h3>Important Directories</h3>
 
<p>One of the basic tasks involved in setting up a
Hadoop cluster is determining where the several various Hadoop-related
directories will be located. Where they go is up to you; in some cases,
the default locations are inadvisable and should be changed. This
section identifies these directories.</p>
 
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Directory</th>

      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Default location</th>
      <th>Suggested location</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>HADOOP_LOG_DIR</td>
      <td>Output location for log files from daemons</td>

      <td>${HADOOP_HOME}/logs</td>
      <td>/var/log/hadoop</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>hadoop.tmp.dir</td>
      <td>A base for other temporary directories</td>
      <td>/tmp/hadoop-${user.name}</td>

      <td>/tmp/hadoop</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dfs.name.dir</td>
      <td>Where the NameNode metadata should be stored</td>
      <td>${hadoop.tmp.dir}/dfs/name</td>
      <td>/home/hadoop/dfs/name</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>dfs.data.dir</td>
      <td>Where DataNodes store their blocks</td>
      <td>${hadoop.tmp.dir}/dfs/data</td>
      <td>/home/hadoop/dfs/data</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>mapred.system.dir</td>
      <td>The in-HDFS path to shared MapReduce system files</td>
      <td>${hadoop.tmp.dir}/mapred/system</td>
      <td>/hadoop/mapred/system</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

</table>
 
<p>This table is not exhaustive; several other
directories are listed in <tt>conf/hadoop-defaults.xml</tt>. The
remaining directories, however, are initialized by default to reside
under <tt>hadoop.tmp.dir</tt>, and are unlikely to be a concern.</p>
 
<p>It is <b>critically important</b> in a real cluster
that <tt>dfs.name.dir</tt> and <tt>dfs.data.dir</tt> be moved out
from <tt>hadoop.tmp.dir</tt>. A real cluster should never consider
these directories temporary, as they are where all persistent HDFS data
resides. Production clusters should have two paths listed for <tt>dfs.name.dir</tt>

which are on two different physical file systems, to ensure that
cluster metadata is preserved in the event of hardware failure.</p>
 
<p>A multi-user configuration should also definitely
adjust <tt>mapred.system.dir</tt>. Hadoop's default installation is
designed to work for standalone operation, which does not use HDFS.
Thus it conflates HDFS and local file system paths. When enabling HDFS,
however, MapReduce will store shared information about jobs in <tt>mapred.system.dir</tt>
on the DFS. If this path includes the current username (as the default <tt>hadoop.tmp.dir</tt>
does), this will prevent proper operation. The current username on the
submitting node will be the username who actually submits the job,
e.g., "alex." All other nodes will have the current username set to the
username used to launch Hadoop itself (e.g., "hadoop"). If these do not
match, the TaskTrackers will be unable to find the job information and
run the MapReduce job.</p>
 
<p>For this reason, it is also advisable to remove <tt>${user.name}</tt>

from the general <tt>hadoop.tmp.dir</tt>. </p>
 
<p>While most of the directories listed above (all the
ones with names in "foo.bar.baz" form) can be relocated via the <tt>conf/hadoop-site.xml</tt>
file, the <tt>HADOOP_LOG_DIR</tt> directory is specified in <tt>conf/hadoop-env.sh</tt>
as an environment variable. Relocating this directory requires editing
this script. </p>

<a name="machines"></a>
<h3>Selecting Machines</h3>
 
<p>Before diving into the details of configuring
nodes, we include a brief word on choosing hardware for a cluster.
While the processing demands of different organizations will dictate a
different machine configuration for optimum efficiency, there are are
commonalities associated with most Hadoop-based tasks.</p>
 
<p>Hadoop is designed to take advantage of whatever
hardware is available. Modest "beige box" PCs can be used to run small
Hadoop setups for experimentation and debugging. Providing greater
computational resources will, to a point, result in increased
performance by your Hadoop cluster. Many existing Hadoop deployments
include Xeon processors in the 1.8-2.0GHz range. Hadoop jobs written in
Java can consume between 1 and 2 GB of RAM per core. If you use
HadoopStreaming to write your jobs in a scripting language such as
Python, more memory may be advisable. Due to the I/O-bound nature of
Hadoop, adding higher-clocked CPUs may not be the most efficient use of
resources, unless the intent is to run HadoopStreaming. Big data
clusters, of course, can use as many large and fast hard drives as are
available. However, too many disks in a single machine will result in
many disks not being used in parallel. It is better to have three
machines with 4 hard disks each than one machine with 12 drives. The
former configuration will be able to write to more drives in parallel
and will provide greater throughput. Finally, gigabit Ethernet
connections between machines will greatly improve performance over a
cluster connected via a slower network interface.</p>
 
<p> It should be noted that the lower limit on
minimum requirements for running Hadoop is well below the
specifications for modern desktop or server class machines. However,
multiple pages on the Hadoop wiki suggest similar specifications to
those posted here for high-performance cluster design. (See <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HardwareBenchmarks">[1]</a>,&nbsp;

<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/MachineScaling">[2]</a>.) </p>

<a name="configs"></a>
<h3>Cluster Configurations</h3>
 
<p>This section provides cluster configuration advice
and specific settings for clusters of varying sizes. These sizes were
picked to demonstrate basic categories of clusters; your own
installation may be a hybrid of different aspects of these profiles.
Here we suggest various properties which should be included in the <tt>conf/hadoop-site.xml</tt>
file to most effectively use a cluster of a given size, as well as
other system configuration elements. The next section describes how to
finish the installation after implementing the configurations described
here. You should read through each of these configurations in order, as
configuration suggestions for larger deployments are based on the
preceding ones. </p>
  
<a name="config-small"></a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Small Clusters: 2-10 Nodes</h4>
 
<p>Setting up a small cluster for development
purposes is a very straightforward task. When using two nodes, one node
will act as both NameNode/JobTracker and a DataNode/TaskTracker; the
other node is only a DataNode/TaskTracker. Clusters of three or more
machines typically use a dedicated NameNode/JobTracker, and all other
nodes are workers.</p>
 
<p>A relatively minimalist configuration in <tt>conf/hadoop-site.xml</tt>
will suffice for this installation:</p>
 
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">&lt;configuration&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;mapred.job.tracker&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;head.server.node.com:9001&lt;/value&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;fs.default.name&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;hdfs://head.server.node.com:9000&lt;/value&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.data.dir&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/home/hadoop/dfs/data&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.name.dir&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/home/hadoop/dfs/name&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;hadoop.tmp.dir&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/tmp/hadoop&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;mapred.system.dir&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/hadoop/mapred/system&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.replication&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;2&lt;/value&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>&lt;/configuration&gt;</pre>

</div>
 
<p>Clusters closer to the 8-10 node range may
want to set <tt>dfs.replication</tt> to 3. Values higher than 3 are
usually not necessary. Individual files which are heavily utilized by a
large number of nodes may have their particular replication factor
manually adjusted upward independent of the cluster default.</p>
  
<a name="config-medium"></a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Medium Clusters: 10-40 Nodes</h4>
 
<p>This category is for clusters that occupy
the majority of a single rack. Additional considerations for high
availability and reliability come into play at this level.</p>

 
<p>The single point of failure in a Hadoop
cluster is the NameNode. While the loss of any other machine
(intermittently or permanently) does not result in data loss, NameNode
loss results in cluster unavailability. The permanent loss of NameNode
data would render the cluster's HDFS inoperable.</p>
 
<p>Therefore, another step should be taken in
this configuration to back up the NameNode metadata. One machine in the
cluster should be designated as the NameNode's backup. This machine
does not run the normal Hadoop daemons (i.e., the DataNode and
TaskTracker). Instead, it exposes a directory via NFS which is only
mounted on the NameNode (e.g., <tt>/mnt/namenode-backup/</tt>). The
cluster's <tt>hadoop-site.xml</tt> file should then instruct the
NameNode to write to this directory as well: </p>
 
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.name.dir&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/home/hadoop/dfs/name,/mnt/namenode-backup&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
 
<p>The NameNode will write its metadata to <i>each</i>
directory in the comma-separated list of <tt>dfs.name.dir</tt>. If <tt>/mnt/namenode-backup</tt>
is NFS-mounted from the backup machine, this will ensure that a
redundant copy of HDFS metadata is available. The backup node should
serve <tt>/mnt/namenode-backup</tt> from <tt>/home/hadoop/dfs/name</tt>

on its own drive. This way, if the NameNode hardware completely dies,
the backup machine can be brought up as the NameNode with no
reconfiguration of the backup machine's software. To switch the
NameNode and backup nodes, the backup machine should have its IP
address changed to the original NameNode's IP address, and the server
daemons should be started on that machine. The IP address must be
changed to allow the DataNodes to recognize it as the "original"
NameNode for HDFS. (Individual DataNodes will cache the DNS entry
associated with the NameNode, so just changing the hostname is
insufficient; the name reassignment must be performed at the IP address
level.)</p>
 
<p>The backup machine still has Hadoop
installed and configured on it in the same way as every other node in
the cluster, but it is not listed in the <tt>slaves</tt> file, so
normal daemons are not started there.</p>
 
<p>One function that the backup machine can be
used for is to serve as the <i>SecondaryNameNode</i>. Note that this
is not a failover NameNode process. The SecondaryNameNode process
connects to the NameNode and takes periodic snapshots of its metadata
(though not in real time). The NameNode metadata consists of a snapshot
of the file system called the <tt>fsimage</tt> and a series of deltas
to this snapshot called the <tt>editlog</tt>. With these two files,
the current state of the system can be determined exactly. The
SecondaryNameNode merges the <tt>fsimage</tt> and <tt>editlog</tt>

into a new <tt>fsimage</tt> file that is a more compact representation
of the file system state. Because this process can be memory intensive,
running it on the backup machine (instead of on the NameNode itself)
can be advantageous.</p>
 
<p>To configure the SecondaryNameNode daemon to
run on the backup machine instead of on the master machine, edit the <tt>conf/masters</tt>
file so that it contains the name of the backup machine. The <tt>bin/start-dfs.sh</tt>
and <tt>bin/start-mapred.sh</tt> (and by extension, <tt>bin/start-all.sh</tt>)
scripts will actually always start the master daemons (NameNode and
JobTracker) on the local machine. The <tt>slaves</tt> file is used for
starting DataNodes and TaskTrackers. The <tt>masters</tt> file is used
for starting the SecondaryNameNode. This filename is used despite the
fact that the master node may not be listed in the file itself.</p>

 
<p>A cluster of this size may also require
nodes to be periodically decommissioned. As noted in <a href="module2.html">Module 2</a>, several machines cannot be turned
off simultaneously, or data loss may occur. Nodes must be
decommissioned on a schedule that permits replication of blocks being
decommissioned. To prepare for this eventuality in advance, an <i>excludes</i>
file should be added to the <tt>conf/hadoop-site.xml</tt>: </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.hosts.exclude&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/home/hadoop/excludes&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;mapred.hosts.exclude&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/home/hadoop/excludes&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
<p>This property should provide the full path to the excludes file (the
actual location of the file is up to you). You should then create an
empty file with this name:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">$ touch /home/hadoop/excludes</pre>
</div>
<p>While the <tt>dfs.hosts.exclude</tt> property allows the definition
of a list of machines which are explicitly barred from connecting to
the NameNode (and similarly, <tt>mapred.hosts.exclude</tt> for the
JobTracker), a large cluster may want to explicitly manage a list of
machines which are approved to connect to a given JobTracker or
NameNode.</p>
<p>The <tt>dfs.hosts</tt> and <tt>mapred.hosts</tt> properties allow
an administrator to supply a file containing an approved list of
hostnames. If a machine is not in this list, it will be denied access
to the cluster. This can be used to enforce policies regarding which
teams of developers have access to which MapReduce sub-clusters. These
are configured in exactly the same way as the excludes file.</p>

<p>Of course, at this scale and above, 3 replicas of each block are
advisable; the <tt>hadoop-site.xml</tt> file should contain:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.replication&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;3&lt;/value&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
<p>By default, HDFS does not preserve any free space on the DataNodes;
the DataNode service will continue to accept blocks until all free
space on the disk is exhausted, which may cause problems. The following
setting will require each DataNode to reserve at least 1 GB of space on
the drive free before it writes more blocks, which helps preserve
system stability:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.datanode.du.reserved&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;1073741824&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
<p>Another parameter to watch is the heap size associated with each
task. Hadoop caps the heap of each task process at 200 MB, which is too
small for most data processing tasks. This cap is set as a parameter
passed to the child Java process. It is common to override this with a
higher cap by specifying: </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;mapred.child.java.opts&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;-Xmx512m&lt;/value&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
<p>This will provide each child task with 512 MB of heap. It is not
unreasonable in some cases to specify <tt>-Xmx1024m</tt> instead. In
the interest of providing only what is actually required, it may be
better to leave this set to 512 MB by default, and allowing
applications to manually configure for a full GB of RAM/task themselves.</p>
<h4>Using multiple drives per machine</h4>
<p>While small clusters often have only one hard drive per machine,
more high-performance configurations may include two or more disks per
node. Slight configuration changes are required to make Hadoop take
advantage of additional disks. </p>
<p>DataNodes can be configured to write blocks out to multiple disks
via the <tt>dfs.data.dir</tt> property. It can take on a
comma-separated list of directories. Each block is written to one of
these directories. E.g., assuming that there are four disks, mounted on
<tt>/d1</tt>, <tt>/d2</tt>, <tt>/d3</tt>, and <tt>/d4</tt>, the
following (or something like it) should be in the configuration for
each DataNode:</p>

<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.data.dir&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/d1/dfs/data,/d2/dfs/data,/d3/dfs/data,/d4/dfs/data&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
<p>MapReduce performance can also be improved by distributing the
temporary data generated by MapReduce tasks across multiple disks on
each machine:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;mapred.local.dir&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;/d1/mapred/local,/d2/mapred/local,/d3/mapred/local,/d4/mapred/local&lt;/value&gt;<br>    &lt;final&gt;true&lt;/final&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
<p>Finally, if there are multiple drives available in the NameNode,
they can be used to provide additional redundant copies of the NameNode
metadata in the event of the failure of one drive. Unlike the above two
properties, where one drive out of many is selected to write a piece of
data, the NameNode writes to <i>each</i> comma-separated path in <tt>dfs.name.dir</tt>.
If too many drives are listed here it may adversely affect the
performance of the NameNode, as the probability of blocking on one or
more I/O operations increases with the number of devices involved, but
it is imperative that the sole copy of the metadata does not reside on
a single drive. </p>

<a name="config-large"> </a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Large Clusters: Multiple Racks</h4>
 
<p>Configuring multiple racks of machines for
Hadoop requires further advance planning. The possibility of rack
failure now exists, and operational racks should be able to continue
even if entire other racks are disabled. Naive setups may result in
large cross-rack data transfers which adversely affect performance.
Furthermore, in a large cluster, the amount of metadata under the care
of the NameNode increases. This section proposes configuring several
properties to help Hadoop operate at very large scale, but the numbers
used in this section are just guidelines. There is no single magic
number which works for all deployments, and individual tuning will be
necessary. These will, however, provide a starting point and alert you
to settings which will be important. </p>
 

<p>The NameNode is responsible for managing
metadata associated with each block in the HDFS. As the amount of
information in the rack scales into the 10's or 100's of TB, this can
grow to be quite sizable. The NameNode machine needs to keep the
blockmap in RAM to work efficiently. Therefore, at large scale, this
machine will require more RAM than other machines in the cluster. The
amount of metadata can also be dropped almost in half by doubling the
block size:</p>
 
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.block.size&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;134217728&lt;/value&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
 
<p>This changes the block size from 64MB (the
default) to 128MB, which decreases pressure on the NameNode's memory.
On the other hand, this potentially decreases the amount of parallelism
that can be achieved, as the number of blocks per file decreases. This
means fewer hosts may have sections of a file to offer to MapReduce
tasks without contending for disk access. The larger the individual
files involved (or the more files involved in the average MapReduce
job), the less of an issue this is. </p>
 
<p>In the medium configuration, the NameNode
wrote HDFS metadata through to another machine on the rack via NFS. It
also used that same machine to checkpoint the NameNode metadata and
compact it in the SecondaryNameNode process. Using this same setup will
result in the cluster being dependent on a single rack's continued
operation. The NFS-mounted write-through backup should be placed in a
different rack from the NameNode, to ensure that the metadata for the
file system survives the failure of an individual rack. For the same
reason, the SecondaryNameNode should be instantiated on a separate rack
as well. </p>
 
<p>With multiple racks of servers, RPC timeouts
may become more frequent. The NameNode takes a continual census of
DataNodes and their health via heartbeat messages sent every few
seconds. A similar timeout mechanism exists on the MapReduce side with
the JobTracker. With many racks of machines, they may force one another
to timeout because the master node is not handling them fast enough.
The following options increase the number of threads on the master
machine dedicated to handling RPC's from slave nodes:</p>
 
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;dfs.namenode.handler.count&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;40&lt;/value&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;<br>  &lt;property&gt;<br>    &lt;name&gt;mapred.job.tracker.handler.count&lt;/name&gt;<br>    &lt;value&gt;40&lt;/value&gt;<br>  &lt;/property&gt;</pre>

</div>
 
<p>These settings were used in clusters of
several hundred nodes. They should be scaled up accordingly with larger
deployments.</p>
 
<p>The following settings provide additional
starting points for optimization. These are based on the reported
configurations of actual clusters from 250 to 2000 nodes.</p>

<h4>Rack awareness</h4>
 

<p>In a multi-rack configuration, it is
important to ensure that replicas of blocks are placed on multiple
racks to minimize the possibility of data loss. Thus, a rack-aware
placement policy should be used. A basic rack awareness script is
provided in <a href="module2.html#rack">Module 2</a>. The
guidelines there suggest how to set up a basic rack awareness policy;
due to the heterogeneity of network topologies, a definitive
general-purpose solution cannot be provided here. </p>
<p>This tutorial targets Hadoop version 0.18.0. While most of the
interfaces described will work on other, older versions of Hadoop,
rack-awareness underwent a major overhaul in version 0.17. Thus, the
following does not apply to version 0.16 and before.</p>
<p>One major consequence of the upgrade is that while rack-aware block
replica placement has existed in Hadoop for some time, rack-aware <i>task</i>
placement has only been added in version 0.17. If Hadoop MapReduce
cannot place a task on the same node as the block of data which the
task is scheduled to process, then it picks an arbitrary different node
on which to schedule the task. Starting with 0.17.0, tasks will be
placed (when possible) on the same rack as at least one replica of an
input data block for a job, which should further minimize the amount of
inter-rack data transfers required to perform a job.</p>
<p>Hadoop includes an interface called <i>DNSToSwitchMapping</i> which
allows arbitrary Java code to be used to map servers onto a rack
topology. The configuration key <tt>topology.node.switch.mapping.impl</tt>

can be used to specify a class which meets this interface. More
straightforward than writing a Java class for this purpose, however, is
to use the default mapper, which executes a user-specified script (or
other command) on each node of the cluster, which returns the rack id
for that node. These rack ids are then aggregated and sent back to the
NameNode.</p>
<p>Note that the rack mapping script used by this system is
incompatible with the 0.16 method of using <tt>dfs.network.script</tt>.
Whereas <tt>dfs.network.script</tt> runs on each DataNode, a new
script specified by <tt>topology.script.file.name</tt> is run by the
master node only. To set the rack mapping script, specify the key <tt>topology.script.file.name</tt>
in <tt>conf/hadoop-site.xml</tt>. </p>

<h4>Cluster contention</h4>
<p>If you are configuring a large number of machines, it is likely that
you have a large number of users who wish to submit jobs to execute on
it. Hadoop's job scheduling algorithm is based on a simple FIFO
scheduler. Using this in a large deployment without external controls
or policies agreed upon by all users can lead to lots of contention for
the JobTracker, causing short jobs to be delayed by other long-running
tasks and frustrating users.</p>
<p>An advanced technique to combat this problem is to configure a
single HDFS cluster which spans all available machines, and configure
several separate MapReduce clusters with their own JobTrackers and
pools of TaskTrackers. All MapReduce clusters are configured to use the
same DFS and the same NameNode; but separate groups of machines have a
different machine acting as JobTracker (i.e., subclusters have
different settings for <tt>mapred.job.tracker</tt>). Breaking machines
up into several smaller clusters, each of which contains 20-40
TaskTrackers, provides users with lower contention for the system.
Users may be assigned to different clusters by policy, or they can use
the JobTracker status web pages (a web page exposed on port 50030 of
each JobTracker) to determine which is underutilized.</p>
<p>Multiple strategies exist for this assignment process. It is
considered best practice to stripe the TaskTrackers associated with
each JobTracker across all racks. This maximizes the availability of
each cluster (as they are all resistant to individual rack failure),
and works with the HDFS replica placement policy to ensure that each
MapReduce cluster can find rack-local replicas of all files used in any
MapReduce jobs.</p>

<a name="monitoring"></a>
<h3>Performance Monitoring</h3>
 
<p>Multiple tools exist to monitor large clusters
for performance and troubleshooting. This section briefly highlights
two such tools.</p>

<a name="ganglia"></a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Ganglia</h4>
 
<p><a href="http://ganglia.info/">Ganglia</a> is a performance
monitoring framework for distributed systems. Ganglia provides a
distributed service which collects metrics on individual machines and
forwards them to an aggregator which can report back to an
administrator on the global state of a cluster.</p>
<p>Ganglia is designed to be integrated into other applications to
collect statistics about their operation. Hadoop includes a performance
monitoring framework which can use Ganglia as its backend. Instructions
are available <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/GangliaMetrics">on
the Hadoop wiki</a> as to how to enable Ganglia metrics in Hadoop.
Instructions are also included below.</p>
<p>After installing and configuring Ganglia on your cluster, to direct
Hadoop to output its metric reports to Ganglia, create a file named <tt>hadoop-metrics.properties</tt>

in the <tt>$HADOOP_HOME/conf</tt> directory. The file should have the
following contents: </p>
<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">dfs.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics.ganglia.GangliaContext<br>dfs.period=10<br>dfs.servers=localhost:8649<br><br>mapred.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics.ganglia.GangliaContext<br>mapred.period=10<br>mapred.servers=localhost:8649</pre>
</div>
<p>This assumes that <tt>gmond</tt> is running on each machine in the
cluster. Instructions on the Hadoop wiki note that (in the experience
of the wiki article author) this may result in all nodes reporting
their results as "localhost" instead of with their individual
hostnames. If this problem affects your cluster, an alternate
configuration is proposed, in which all Hadoop instances speak directly
with <tt>gmetad</tt>:</p>

<div class="code"><pre class="codeblue">dfs.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics.ganglia.GangliaContext<br>dfs.period=10<br>dfs.servers=@GMETAD@:8650<br><br>mapred.class=org.apache.hadoop.metrics.ganglia.GangliaContext<br>mapred.period=10<br>mapred.servers=@GMETAD@:8650</pre>
</div>
<p>Where <tt>@GMETAD@</tt> is the hostname of the server on which the <tt>gmetad</tt>
service is running. If deploying Ganglia and Hadoop on a very large
number of machines, the impact of this configuration (vs. the standard
Ganglia configuration where individual services talk to <tt>gmond</tt>

on <tt>localhost</tt>) should be evaluated. </p>

<a name="nagios"></a>
<h4 class="sectionSubH">Nagios</h4>
 
<p>While Ganglia will monitor Hadoop-specific metrics,
general information about the health of the cluster should be monitored
with an additional tool.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nagios.org/">Nagios</a> is a machine and service
monitoring system designed for large clusters. Nagios will provide
useful diagnostic information for tuning your cluster, including
network, disk, and CPU utilization across machines.</p>

<a name="tips"></a>
<h3>Additional Tips</h3>
 
<p>The following are a few additional pieces of small
advice:</p>
 
<ul>
   
  <li class="bullist">Create a separate user named "hadoop" to run your
instances; this will separate the Hadoop processes from any users on
the system. Do not run Hadoop as root.</li>

   
  <li class="bullist">If Hadoop is installed in <tt>/home/hadoop/hadoop-0.18.0</tt>,
link <tt>/home/hadoop/hadoop</tt> to <tt>/home/hadoop/hadoop-0.18.0</tt>.
When upgrading to a newer version in the future, the link can be moved
to make this process easier on other scripts that depend on the <tt>hadoop/bin</tt>
directory.</li>
